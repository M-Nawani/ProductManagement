PRODUCT BRAINSTORM IDEAS - CAB AGGREGATORS

* Problems
    * Drivers refuse service 
    * Long wait times for a cab
    * Pool trips take long time to reach destination 
    * Safety
* Ideas
    * Divide the city maps into zones (eg: Like any railway does) and each driver will drive in his/her zones and then the user can change cabs (the user still books just once)
    * Recurring cab services, if the user uses the service everyday for the same time and same place, maybe start monthly charges. This recurring idea also can build trust between the user and the same driver.
    * For pool, build services like S-pool that cater to solely on share rides without wasting time 
    * For safety, add SOS options in the app that work in offline mode too, voice commands , and blast sms to the family and local police.
